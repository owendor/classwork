## AI Code Review

The AI told me that I could avoid redundant copying by directly operating on the original string. The code it gave me (which I didn't ask for) was much cleaner and more efficient than my own, although it included some whitespace characters that I think are unnecessary. For this reason, I implemented the new code without the extra characters.

I had to include <string.h> in order for memcpy() to work.
